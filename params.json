{"name":"Roadkill","tagline":".NET Wiki engine","body":"* [Report Bugs](https://bitbucket.org/mrshrinkray/roadkill/issues)\r\n* [Forum/suggestions](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/roadkillwiki)\r\n* [View the current build status](https://roadkill.atlassian.net/builds/browse/ROADKILL-ROADKILL)\r\n* [Trello/scrum board](https://trello.com/board/roadkill/50fd8e65514904981d000167)\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nRoadkill .NET is a lightweight but powerful Wiki engine built on the following foundations:\r\n\r\n* .NET 4.0\r\n* jQuery\r\n* ASP.NET MVC 3 with Razor\r\n* Lucene.net search engine\r\n* Creole, Media Wiki and Markdown syntax support\r\n* Bootstrap-based UI.\r\n* Supports SQL Server, SQL Server CE, Sqlite, MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB\r\n* It's themeable, well documented, supports Active Directory authentication and is (I hope) extremely easy to use. It's Free Open Source (FOSS)\r\n\r\nRoadkill comes with a Screwturn import tool (Settings->Tools). This imports all pages, history, categories/tags and images as well.\r\n\r\n## Demo site\r\n\r\nhttp://www.roadkillwiki.net\r\n\r\nLogin: editor@roadkillwiki.net\r\nPassword: password\r\n\r\nPlease note: the Codeplex issues tracker *is not* monitored.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nCurrently looking for people to contribute language files (around 500 words and short phrases), for more information please ask on the Google Groups forum.\r\n\r\nC# contributions are also welcome, but require a fair amount of experience with NHibernate, ASP.NET MVC/Razor or jQuery/HTML (pick two).\r\n\r\n*Please use Bitbucket to provide patches/pull requests/clones* (Codeplex is a mirror repository)\r\n\r\n## Mini-roadmap\r\n\r\nThere are no time frames for releases, however they are generally 1-2 months apart.\r\n\r\n*Version 1.6:*\r\n * Move away from NHibernate\r\n * Improved and more flexible site configuration\r\n * You tube video tag\r\n\r\n*Version 2.0:*\r\n * Built using ASP.NET MVC 4/ .NET 4.5\r\n * REST API built using the new ASP.NET Web API\r\n * Mobile stylesheets\r\n * Plugin framework for page creation/editing events\r\n * Desktop/personal installation\r\n * Improved test coverage\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nAt http://roadkill.codeplex.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
